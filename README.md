CLiX
====

The CLiX project is a document transformation system which reads an XML
file and allows the definition of transformation patterns to steer the
transformation process.

This software was developed as part of a University project way back.
However, recently I was reminded of it since it quite nicely demonstrates
the use of the CLOS metaopbject protocol (MOP) to implement predicate
dispatching for generic functions in Common Lisp. Especially this part
may be of interest to others.
