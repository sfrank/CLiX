\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Now is the winter of our discontent\\
\hspace{1pt}Made glorious summer by this sun of York;\\
\hspace{1pt}And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\\
\hspace{1pt}In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\\
\hspace{1pt}Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\\
\hspace{1pt}Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\\
\hspace{1pt}Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\\
\hspace{1pt}Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\\
\hspace{1pt}Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;\\
\hspace{1pt}And now, instead of mounting barded steeds\\
\hspace{1pt}To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\\
\hspace{1pt}He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\\
\hspace{1pt}To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\\
\hspace{1pt}But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\\
\hspace{1pt}Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\\
\hspace{1pt}I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty\\
\hspace{1pt}To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\\
\hspace{1pt}I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,\\
\hspace{1pt}Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\\
\hspace{1pt}Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time\\
\hspace{1pt}Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,\\
\hspace{1pt}And that so lamely and unfashionable\\
\hspace{1pt}That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\\
\hspace{1pt}Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\\
\hspace{1pt}Have no delight to pass away the time,\\
\hspace{1pt}Unless to spy my shadow in the sun\\
\hspace{1pt}And descant on mine own deformity:\\
\hspace{1pt}And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\\
\hspace{1pt}To entertain these fair well-spoken days,\\
\hspace{1pt}I am determined to prove a villain\\
\hspace{1pt}And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\\
\hspace{1pt}Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\\
\hspace{1pt}By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,\\
\hspace{1pt}To set my brother Clarence and the king\\
\hspace{1pt}In deadly hate the one against the other:\\
\hspace{1pt}And if King Edward be as true and just\\
\hspace{1pt}As I am subtle, false and treacherous,\\
\hspace{1pt}This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,\\
\hspace{1pt}About a prophecy, which says that 'G'\\
\hspace{1pt}Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.\\
\hspace{1pt}Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here\\
\hspace{1pt}Clarence comes.\\
{\it [Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY]}\\
\hspace{1pt}Brother, good day; what means this armed guard\\
\hspace{1pt}That waits upon your grace?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}His majesty\\
\hspace{1pt}Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed\\
\hspace{1pt}This conduct to convey me to the Tower.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Upon what cause?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Because my name is George.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;\\
\hspace{1pt}He should, for that, commit your godfathers:\\
\hspace{1pt}O, belike his majesty hath some intent\\
\hspace{1pt}That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.\\
\hspace{1pt}But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest\\
\hspace{1pt}As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,\\
\hspace{1pt}He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;\\
\hspace{1pt}And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.\\
\hspace{1pt}And says a wizard told him that by G\\
\hspace{1pt}His issue disinherited should be;\\
\hspace{1pt}And, for my name of George begins with G,\\
\hspace{1pt}It follows in his thought that I am he.\\
\hspace{1pt}These, as I learn, and such like toys as these\\
\hspace{1pt}Have moved his highness to commit me now.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:\\
\hspace{1pt}'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:\\
\hspace{1pt}My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she\\
\hspace{1pt}That tempers him to this extremity.\\
\hspace{1pt}Was it not she and that good man of worship,\\
\hspace{1pt}Anthony Woodville, her brother there,\\
\hspace{1pt}That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\\
\hspace{1pt}From whence this present day he is deliver'd?\\
\hspace{1pt}We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}By heaven, I think there's no man is secure\\
\hspace{1pt}But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds\\
\hspace{1pt}That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.\\
\hspace{1pt}Heard ye not what an humble suppliant\\
\hspace{1pt}Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Humbly complaining to her deity\\
\hspace{1pt}Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.\\
\hspace{1pt}I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,\\
\hspace{1pt}If we will keep in favour with the king,\\
\hspace{1pt}To be her men and wear her livery:\\
\hspace{1pt}The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,\\
\hspace{1pt}Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.\\
\hspace{1pt}Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[BRAKENBURY:] 
\hspace{1pt}I beseech your graces both to pardon me;\\
\hspace{1pt}His majesty hath straitly given in charge\\
\hspace{1pt}That no man shall have private conference,\\
\hspace{1pt}Of what degree soever, with his brother.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,\\
\hspace{1pt}You may partake of any thing we say:\\
\hspace{1pt}We speak no treason, man: we say the king\\
\hspace{1pt}Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen\\
\hspace{1pt}Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;\\
\hspace{1pt}We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,\\
\hspace{1pt}A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\\
\hspace{1pt}And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:\\
\hspace{1pt}How say you sir? Can you deny all this?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[BRAKENBURY:] 
\hspace{1pt}With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,\\
\hspace{1pt}He that doth naught with her, excepting one,\\
\hspace{1pt}Were best he do it secretly, alone.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[BRAKENBURY:] 
\hspace{1pt}What one, my lord?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[BRAKENBURY:] 
\hspace{1pt}I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal\\
\hspace{1pt}Forbear your conference with the noble duke.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.\\
\hspace{1pt}Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;\\
\hspace{1pt}And whatsoever you will employ me in,\\
\hspace{1pt}Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,\\
\hspace{1pt}I will perform it to enfranchise you.\\
\hspace{1pt}Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood\\
\hspace{1pt}Touches me deeper than you can imagine.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}I know it pleaseth neither of us well.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;\\
\hspace{1pt}Meantime, have patience.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}I must perforce. Farewell.\\
\end{description}
\centering{\it [Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard]}\\
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.\\
\hspace{1pt}Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,\\
\hspace{1pt}That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,\\
\hspace{1pt}If heaven will take the present at our hands.\\
\hspace{1pt}But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?\\
\end{description}
\centering{\it [Enter HASTINGS]}\\
\begin{description}
\item[HASTINGS:] 
\hspace{1pt}Good time of day unto my gracious lord!\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}As much unto my good lord chamberlain!\\
\hspace{1pt}Well are you welcome to the open air.\\
\hspace{1pt}How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[HASTINGS:] 
\hspace{1pt}With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:\\
\hspace{1pt}But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks\\
\hspace{1pt}That were the cause of my imprisonment.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;\\
\hspace{1pt}For they that were your enemies are his,\\
\hspace{1pt}And have prevail'd as much on him as you.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[HASTINGS:] 
\hspace{1pt}More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,\\
\hspace{1pt}While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}What news abroad?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[HASTINGS:] 
\hspace{1pt}No news so bad abroad as this at home;\\
\hspace{1pt}The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,\\
\hspace{1pt}And his physicians fear him mightily.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.\\
\hspace{1pt}O, he hath kept an evil diet long,\\
\hspace{1pt}And overmuch consumed his royal person:\\
\hspace{1pt}'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.\\
\hspace{1pt}What, is he in his bed?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[HASTINGS:] 
\hspace{1pt}He is.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Go you before, and I will follow you.\\
{\it [Exit HASTINGS]}\\
\hspace{1pt}He cannot live, I hope; and must not die\\
\hspace{1pt}Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.\\
\hspace{1pt}I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,\\
\hspace{1pt}With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;\\
\hspace{1pt}And, if I fall not in my deep intent,\\
\hspace{1pt}Clarence hath not another day to live:\\
\hspace{1pt}Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,\\
\hspace{1pt}And leave the world for me to bustle in!\\
\hspace{1pt}For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.\\
\hspace{1pt}What though I kill'd her husband and her father?\\
\hspace{1pt}The readiest way to make the wench amends\\
\hspace{1pt}Is to become her husband and her father:\\
\hspace{1pt}The which will I; not all so much for love\\
\hspace{1pt}As for another secret close intent,\\
\hspace{1pt}By marrying her which I must reach unto.\\
\hspace{1pt}But yet I run before my horse to market:\\
\hspace{1pt}Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:\\
\hspace{1pt}When they are gone, then must I count my gains.\\

\subsection*{SCENE II.  The same. Another street.}
\centering{\it [Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen
with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner]}\\
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Set down, set down your honourable load,\\
\hspace{1pt}If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,\\
\hspace{1pt}Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament\\
\hspace{1pt}The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.\\
\hspace{1pt}Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!\\
\hspace{1pt}Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!\\
\hspace{1pt}Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!\\
\hspace{1pt}Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,\\
\hspace{1pt}To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,\\
\hspace{1pt}Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,\\
\hspace{1pt}Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!\\
\hspace{1pt}Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,\\
\hspace{1pt}I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.\\
\hspace{1pt}Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!\\
\hspace{1pt}Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!\\
\hspace{1pt}Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!\\
\hspace{1pt}More direful hap betide that hated wretch,\\
\hspace{1pt}That makes us wretched by the death of thee,\\
\hspace{1pt}Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,\\
\hspace{1pt}Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!\\
\hspace{1pt}If ever he have child, abortive be it,\\
\hspace{1pt}Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,\\
\hspace{1pt}Whose ugly and unnatural aspect\\
\hspace{1pt}May fright the hopeful mother at the view;\\
\hspace{1pt}And that be heir to his unhappiness!\\
\hspace{1pt}If ever he have wife, let her he made\\
\hspace{1pt}A miserable by the death of him\\
\hspace{1pt}As I am made by my poor lord and thee!\\
\hspace{1pt}Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,\\
\hspace{1pt}Taken from Paul's to be interred there;\\
\hspace{1pt}And still, as you are weary of the weight,\\
\hspace{1pt}Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.\\
\end{description}
\centering{\it [Enter GLOUCESTER]}\\
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}What black magician conjures up this fiend,\\
\hspace{1pt}To stop devoted charitable deeds?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,\\
\hspace{1pt}I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Gentleman:] 
\hspace{1pt}My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:\\
\hspace{1pt}Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,\\
\hspace{1pt}Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,\\
\hspace{1pt}And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?\\
\hspace{1pt}Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,\\
\hspace{1pt}And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.\\
\hspace{1pt}Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!\\
\hspace{1pt}Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,\\
\hspace{1pt}His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;\\
\hspace{1pt}For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,\\
\hspace{1pt}Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.\\
\hspace{1pt}If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,\\
\hspace{1pt}Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.\\
\hspace{1pt}O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds\\
\hspace{1pt}Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!\\
\hspace{1pt}Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;\\
\hspace{1pt}For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood\\
\hspace{1pt}From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;\\
\hspace{1pt}Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,\\
\hspace{1pt}Provokes this deluge most unnatural.\\
\hspace{1pt}O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!\\
\hspace{1pt}O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!\\
\hspace{1pt}Either heaven with lightning strike the\\
\hspace{1pt}murderer dead,\\
\hspace{1pt}Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,\\
\hspace{1pt}As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood\\
\hspace{1pt}Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Lady, you know no rules of charity,\\
\hspace{1pt}Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:\\
\hspace{1pt}No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}But I know none, and therefore am no beast.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}More wonderful, when angels are so angry.\\
\hspace{1pt}Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,\\
\hspace{1pt}Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,\\
\hspace{1pt}By circumstance, but to acquit myself.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,\\
\hspace{1pt}For these known evils, but to give me leave,\\
\hspace{1pt}By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have\\
\hspace{1pt}Some patient leisure to excuse myself.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make\\
\hspace{1pt}No excuse current, but to hang thyself.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}By such despair, I should accuse myself.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;\\
\hspace{1pt}For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,\\
\hspace{1pt}Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Say that I slew them not?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Why, then they are not dead:\\
\hspace{1pt}But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}I did not kill your husband.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Why, then he is alive.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw\\
\hspace{1pt}Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;\\
\hspace{1pt}The which thou once didst bend against her breast,\\
\hspace{1pt}But that thy brothers beat aside the point.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,\\
\hspace{1pt}which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.\\
\hspace{1pt}Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:\\
\hspace{1pt}Didst thou not kill this king?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}I grant ye.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too\\
\hspace{1pt}Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!\\
\hspace{1pt}O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;\\
\hspace{1pt}For he was fitter for that place than earth.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}And thou unfit for any place but hell.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Some dungeon.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Your bed-chamber.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}So will it, madam till I lie with you.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}I hope so.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,\\
\hspace{1pt}To leave this keen encounter of our wits,\\
\hspace{1pt}And fall somewhat into a slower method,\\
\hspace{1pt}Is not the causer of the timeless deaths\\
\hspace{1pt}Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,\\
\hspace{1pt}As blameful as the executioner?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Your beauty was the cause of that effect;\\
\hspace{1pt}Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep\\
\hspace{1pt}To undertake the death of all the world,\\
\hspace{1pt}So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,\\
\hspace{1pt}These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;\\
\hspace{1pt}You should not blemish it, if I stood by:\\
\hspace{1pt}As all the world is cheered by the sun,\\
\hspace{1pt}So I by that; it is my day, my life.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[LADY ANNE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!\\
\end{description}

\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:]

\hspace{1pt}To be revenged on him that loveth you.\\

\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}I would they were, that I might die at once;\\
\hspace{1pt}For now they kill me with a living death.\\
\hspace{1pt}Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,\\
\hspace{1pt}Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:\\
\hspace{1pt}These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,\\
\hspace{1pt}No, when my father York and Edward wept,\\
\hspace{1pt}To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made\\
\hspace{1pt}When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;\\
\hspace{1pt}Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,\\
\hspace{1pt}Told the sad story of my father's death,\\
\hspace{1pt}And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,\\
\hspace{1pt}That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks\\
\hspace{1pt}Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time\\
\hspace{1pt}My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;\\
\hspace{1pt}And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,\\
\hspace{1pt}Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.\\
\hspace{1pt}I never sued to friend nor enemy;\\
\hspace{1pt}My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;\\
\hspace{1pt}But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,\\
\hspace{1pt}My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.\\
{\it [She looks scornfully at him]}\\
\hspace{1pt}Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made\\
\hspace{1pt}For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.\\
\hspace{1pt}If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,\\
\hspace{1pt}Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;\\
\hspace{1pt}Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.\\
\hspace{1pt}And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,\\
\hspace{1pt}I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,\\
\hspace{1pt}And humbly beg the death upon my knee.\\
{\it [He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword]}\\
\hspace{1pt}Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,\\
\hspace{1pt}But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.\\
\hspace{1pt}Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,\\
\hspace{1pt}But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.\\
{\it [Here she lets fall the sword]}\\
\hspace{1pt}Take up the sword again, or take up me.\\
\end{description}

\hspace{1pt}I will not be the executioner.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}

\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}Tush, that was in thy rage:\\
\hspace{1pt}Speak it again, and, even with the word,\\
\hspace{1pt}That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,\\
\hspace{1pt}Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;\\
\hspace{1pt}To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.\\

\hspace{1pt}By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly\\

\hspace{1pt}Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,\\
\hspace{1pt}Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,\\
\hspace{1pt}Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,\\
\hspace{1pt}I must be held a rancorous enemy.\\

\hspace{1pt}And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,\\
\hspace{1pt}And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout\\
\hspace{1pt}Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--\\
\hspace{1pt}His curses, then from bitterness of soul\\

\hspace{1pt}That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,\\

\hspace{1pt}Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,\\
\hspace{1pt}His venom tooth will rankle to the death:\\

\hspace{1pt}O, I have pass'd a miserable night,\\

\hspace{1pt}I would not spend another such a night,\\
\hspace{1pt}Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,\\
\hspace{1pt}So full of dismal terror was the time!\\

\item[BRAKENBURY:] 
\hspace{1pt}What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,\\
\hspace{1pt}And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;\\
\hspace{1pt}And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;\\
\hspace{1pt}Who from my cabin tempted me to walk\\
\hspace{1pt}Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,\\
\hspace{1pt}And cited up a thousand fearful times,\\
\hspace{1pt}During the wars of York and Lancaster\\
\hspace{1pt}That had befall'n us. As we paced along\\
\hspace{1pt}Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,\\
\hspace{1pt}Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,\\
\hspace{1pt}Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,\\
\hspace{1pt}Into the tumbling billows of the main.\\
\hspace{1pt}Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!\\
\hspace{1pt}What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!\\
\hspace{1pt}What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!\\
\hspace{1pt}Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;\\
\hspace{1pt}Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;\\
\hspace{1pt}Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\\
\hspace{1pt}Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\\
\hspace{1pt}All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:\\
\hspace{1pt}Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes\\
\hspace{1pt}Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,\\
\hspace{1pt}As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\\
\hspace{1pt}Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,\\
\hspace{1pt}And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[BRAKENBURY:] 
\hspace{1pt}Had you such leisure in the time of death\\
\hspace{1pt}To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?\\

\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Methought I had; and often did I strive\\
\hspace{1pt}To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood\\
\hspace{1pt}Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth\\
\hspace{1pt}To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;\\
\hspace{1pt}But smother'd it within my panting bulk,\\
\hspace{1pt}Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[BRAKENBURY:]

\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;\\
\hspace{1pt}O, then began the tempest to my soul,\\
\hspace{1pt}Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,\\
\hspace{1pt}With that grim ferryman which poets write of,\\
\hspace{1pt}Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.\\
\hspace{1pt}The first that there did greet my stranger soul,\\
\hspace{1pt}Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;\\
\hspace{1pt}Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury\\
\hspace{1pt}Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'\\
\hspace{1pt}And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by\\
\hspace{1pt}A shadow like an angel, with bright hair\\
\hspace{1pt}Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,\\
\hspace{1pt}'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,\\
\hspace{1pt}That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;\\
\hspace{1pt}Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'\\
\hspace{1pt}With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\\
\hspace{1pt}Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears\\
\hspace{1pt}Such hideous cries, that with the very noise\\
\hspace{1pt}I trembling waked, and for a season after\\
\hspace{1pt}Could not believe but that I was in hell,\\
\hspace{1pt}Such terrible impression made the dream.\\
\end{description}

\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}O Brakenbury, I have done those things,\\
\hspace{1pt}Which now bear evidence against my soul,\\
\hspace{1pt}For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!\\
\hspace{1pt}O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,\\
\hspace{1pt}But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,\\
\hspace{1pt}Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,\\
\hspace{1pt}O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\\
\hspace{1pt}I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;\\

\hspace{1pt}accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;\\
\hspace{1pt}he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it\\
\hspace{1pt}detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that\\
\hspace{1pt}mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of\\
\hspace{1pt}obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold\\
\hspace{1pt}that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it\\
\hspace{1pt}is turned out of all towns and cities for a\\
\hspace{1pt}dangerous thing; and every man that means to live\\
\hspace{1pt}well endeavours to trust to himself and to live\\
\hspace{1pt}without it.\\

\item[Second Murderer:]

\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy\\

\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}In God's name, what art thou?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}A man, as you are.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}But not, as I am, royal.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Nor you, as we are, loyal.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!\\
\hspace{1pt}Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?\\
\hspace{1pt}Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Both:] 
\hspace{1pt}To, to, to--\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:]

\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Both:] 
\hspace{1pt}Ay, ay.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,\\
\hspace{1pt}And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.\\

\hspace{1pt}Where are the evidence that do accuse me?\\
\hspace{1pt}What lawful quest have given their verdict up\\
\hspace{1pt}Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced\\
\hspace{1pt}The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?\\
\hspace{1pt}Before I be convict by course of law,\\
\hspace{1pt}To threaten me with death is most unlawful.\\
\hspace{1pt}I charge you, as you hope to have redemption\\
\hspace{1pt}By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,\\
\hspace{1pt}That you depart and lay no hands on me\\
\hspace{1pt}The deed you undertake is damnable.\\
\end{description}

\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}What we will do, we do upon command.\\

\item[Second Murderer:]

\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings\\
\hspace{1pt}Hath in the tables of his law commanded\\
\hspace{1pt}That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,\\
\hspace{1pt}Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?\\
\hspace{1pt}Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,\\
\hspace{1pt}To hurl upon their heads that break his law.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,\\
\hspace{1pt}For false forswearing and for murder too:\\
\hspace{1pt}Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,\\
\hspace{1pt}To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}And, like a traitor to the name of God,\\
\hspace{1pt}Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade\\
\hspace{1pt}Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,\\
\hspace{1pt}When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?\\
\hspace{1pt}For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,\\
\hspace{1pt}He sends ye not to murder me for this\\
\hspace{1pt}For in this sin he is as deep as I.\\
\hspace{1pt}If God will be revenged for this deed.\\
\hspace{1pt}O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,\\
\hspace{1pt}Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;\\
\hspace{1pt}He needs no indirect nor lawless course\\
\hspace{1pt}To cut off those that have offended him.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,\\
\hspace{1pt}When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,\\
\hspace{1pt}That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:]

\begin{description}
\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,\\
\hspace{1pt}Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;\\
\hspace{1pt}I am his brother, and I love him well.\\
\hspace{1pt}If you be hired for meed, go back again,\\
\hspace{1pt}And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,\\
\hspace{1pt}Who shall reward you better for my life\\
\hspace{1pt}Than Edward will for tidings of my death.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.\\

\begin{description}

\hspace{1pt}O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:\\

\begin{description}
\item[Both:] 
\hspace{1pt}Ay, so we will.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Tell him, when that our princely father York\\
\hspace{1pt}Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,\\
\hspace{1pt}And charged us from his soul to love each other,\\
\hspace{1pt}He little thought of this divided friendship:\\
\hspace{1pt}Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}O, do not slander him, for he is kind.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Right,\\
\hspace{1pt}As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:\\
\hspace{1pt}'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}It cannot be; for when I parted with him,\\
\hspace{1pt}He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,\\
\hspace{1pt}That he would labour my delivery.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee\\
\hspace{1pt}From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.\\

\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.\\

\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,\\
\hspace{1pt}To counsel me to make my peace with God,\\
\hspace{1pt}And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,\\
\hspace{1pt}That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?\\
\hspace{1pt}Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on\\
\hspace{1pt}To do this deed will hate you for the deed.\\

\item[First Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[CLARENCE:] 
\hspace{1pt}Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.\\
\hspace{1pt}Which of you, if you were a prince's son,\\
\hspace{1pt}Being pent from liberty, as I am now,\\
\hspace{1pt}if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,\\
\hspace{1pt}Would not entreat for life?\\
\hspace{1pt}My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:\\
\hspace{1pt}O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,\\
\hspace{1pt}Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,\\
\hspace{1pt}As you would beg, were you in my distress\\
\hspace{1pt}A begging prince what beggar pities not?\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}Look behind you, my lord.\\

\begin{description}

\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[Second Murderer:] 
\hspace{1pt}I would he knew that I had saved his brother!\\

\hspace{1pt}Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?\\

\hspace{1pt}Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury\\

\hspace{1pt}Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.\\
\hspace{1pt}Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,\\
\hspace{1pt}And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:\\
\hspace{1pt}But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,\\

\item[HASTINGS:] 
\hspace{1pt}On what occasion, God he knows, not I,\\
\hspace{1pt}The queen your mother, and your brother York,\\

\hspace{1pt}Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,\\
\hspace{1pt}But by his mother was perforce withheld.\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[BUCKINGHAM:] 
\hspace{1pt}Fie, what an indirect and peevish course\\

\hspace{1pt}Unto his princely brother presently?\\
\hspace{1pt}If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,\\

\hspace{1pt}My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory\\

\hspace{1pt}The benefit thereof is always granted\\
\hspace{1pt}To those whose dealings have deserved the place,\\

\hspace{1pt}To be spoke to but by the recorder.\\
\hspace{1pt}Then he was urged to tell my tale again,\\
\hspace{1pt}'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'\\
\hspace{1pt}But nothing spake in warrant from himself.\\
\hspace{1pt}When he had done, some followers of mine own,\\
\hspace{1pt}At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,\\
\hspace{1pt}And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'\\
\hspace{1pt}And thus I took the vantage of those few,\\
\hspace{1pt}'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;\\
\hspace{1pt}'This general applause and loving shout\\
\hspace{1pt}Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'\\
\hspace{1pt}And even here brake off, and came away.\\

\hspace{1pt}Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,\\

\hspace{1pt}Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,\\
\hspace{1pt}Which here we waken to our country's good,\\
\hspace{1pt}This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;\\
\hspace{1pt}Her face defaced with scars of infamy,\\
\hspace{1pt}Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,\\
\hspace{1pt}And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf\\

\hspace{1pt}Which to recure, we heartily solicit\\
\hspace{1pt}Your gracious self to take on you the charge\\
\hspace{1pt}And kingly government of this your land,\\
\hspace{1pt}Not as protector, steward, substitute,\\

\item[GLOUCESTER:] 
\hspace{1pt}I know not whether to depart in silence,\\

\hspace{1pt}Best fitteth my degree or your condition\\
\hspace{1pt}If not to answer, you might haply think\\
\hspace{1pt}Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded\\
\hspace{1pt}To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,\\
\hspace{1pt}Which fondly you would here impose on me;\\
\hspace{1pt}If to reprove you for this suit of yours,\\
\hspace{1pt}So season'd with your faithful love to me.\\
\hspace{1pt}Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.\\
\hspace{1pt}Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,\\
\hspace{1pt}And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,\\
\hspace{1pt}Definitively thus I answer you.\\
\hspace{1pt}Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert\\

\hspace{1pt}First if all obstacles were cut away,\\
\hspace{1pt}And that my path were even to the crown,\\
\hspace{1pt}As my ripe revenue and due by birth\\
\hspace{1pt}Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,\\
\hspace{1pt}So mighty and so many my defects,\\
\hspace{1pt}As I had rather hide me from my greatness,\\
\hspace{1pt}Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,\\
\hspace{1pt}Than in my greatness covet to be hid,\\
\hspace{1pt}And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.\\
\hspace{1pt}But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,\\
\hspace{1pt}And much I need to help you, if need were;\\
\hspace{1pt}The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,\\
\hspace{1pt}Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,\\
\hspace{1pt}Will well become the seat of majesty,\\
\hspace{1pt}And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.\\
\hspace{1pt}On him I lay what you would lay on me,\\
\hspace{1pt}The right and fortune of his happy stars;\\
\hspace{1pt}Which God defend that I should wring from him!\\
\end{description}
\begin{description}
\item[BUCKINGHAM:] 
\hspace{1pt}My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;\\
\hspace{1pt}But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,\\
\hspace{1pt}All circumstances well considered.\\
\hspace{1pt}You say that Edward is your brother's son:\\
\hspace{1pt}So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;\\
\hspace{1pt}For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--\\
\hspace{1pt}Your mother lives a witness to that vow--\\
\hspace{1pt}And afterward by substitute betroth'd\\
\hspace{1pt}To Bona, sister to the King of France.\\
\hspace{1pt}These both put by a poor petitioner,\\
\hspace{1pt}A care-crazed mother of a many children,\\
\hspace{1pt}A beauty-waning and distressed widow,\\
\hspace{1pt}Even in the afternoon of her best days,\\
\hspace{1pt}Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,\\
\hspace{1pt}Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts\\
\hspace{1pt}To base declension and loathed bigamy\\
\hspace{1pt}By her, in his unlawful bed, he got\\
\hspace{1pt}This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.\\
\hspace{1pt}More bitterly could I expostulate,\\
\hspace{1pt}Save that, for reverence to some alive,\\
\hspace{1pt}I give a sparing limit to my tongue.\\
\hspace{1pt}Then, good my lord, take to your royal self\\
\hspace{1pt}This proffer'd benefit of dignity;\\
\hspace{1pt}If non to bless us and the land withal,\\
\hspace{1pt}Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry\\
\hspace{1pt}From the corruption of abusing times,\\
\hspace{1pt}Unto a lineal true-derived course.\\

\hspace{1pt}Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--\\
\hspace{1pt}A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain\\
\hspace{1pt}The purple sap from her sweet brother's body\\

\hspace{1pt}If this inducement force her not to love,\\
\hspace{1pt}Send her a story of thy noble acts;\\

\hspace{1pt}If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,\\
\hspace{1pt}To quicken your increase, I will beget\\
\hspace{1pt}Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter\\
\hspace{1pt}A grandam's name is little less in love\\
\hspace{1pt}Than is the doting title of a mother;\\
\hspace{1pt}They are as children but one step below,\\
\hspace{1pt}Even of your mettle, of your very blood;\\
\hspace{1pt}Of an one pain, save for a night of groans\\
\hspace{1pt}Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.\\
\hspace{1pt}Your children were vexation to your youth,\\
\hspace{1pt}But mine shall be a comfort to your age.\\
\hspace{1pt}The loss you have is but a son being king,\\
\hspace{1pt}And by that loss your daughter is made queen.\\
\hspace{1pt}I cannot make you what amends I would,\\
\hspace{1pt}Therefore accept such kindness as I can.\\
\hspace{1pt}Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul\\
\hspace{1pt}Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,\\
\hspace{1pt}This fair alliance quickly shall call home\\
\hspace{1pt}To high promotions and great dignity:\\
\hspace{1pt}The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.\\
\hspace{1pt}Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;\\
\hspace{1pt}Again shall you be mother to a king,\\
\hspace{1pt}And all the ruins of distressful times\\
\hspace{1pt}Repair'd with double riches of content.\\
\hspace{1pt}What! we have many goodly days to see:\\
\hspace{1pt}The liquid drops of tears that you have shed\\
\hspace{1pt}Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,\\
\hspace{1pt}Advantaging their loan with interest\\
\hspace{1pt}Of ten times double gain of happiness.\\
\hspace{1pt}Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go\\
\hspace{1pt}Make bold her bashful years with your experience;\\
\hspace{1pt}Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale\\
\hspace{1pt}Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame\\
\hspace{1pt}Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess\\
\hspace{1pt}With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys\\
\hspace{1pt}And when this arm of mine hath chastised\\
\hspace{1pt}The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,\\
\hspace{1pt}Bound with triumphant garlands will I come\\
\hspace{1pt}And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;\\
\hspace{1pt}To whom I will retail my conquest won,\\
\hspace{1pt}And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.\\

\hspace{1pt}Under what title shall I woo for thee,\\
\hspace{1pt}That God, the law, my honour and her love,\\

\begin{description}

\hspace{1pt}The children live, whose parents thou hast\\

\hspace{1pt}Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!\\
\hspace{1pt}Be opposite all planets of good luck\\
\hspace{1pt}To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,\\
\hspace{1pt}Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,\\
\hspace{1pt}I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!\\
\hspace{1pt}In her consists my happiness and thine;\\
\hspace{1pt}Without her, follows to this land and me,\\
\hspace{1pt}To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,\\
\hspace{1pt}Death, desolation, ruin and decay:\\
